    <h1 id="html">HTML:-</h1>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web browser.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
        into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
        for the appearance of the document.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
        images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means
        to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
        links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
        directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
    <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
        display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page</p>

    <h1 id="css">CSS:-</h1>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
        in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a
        cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
        separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file
        to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

    <h1 id="javascript">Javascript:-</h1>
    <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
        Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
        behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine
        to execute the code on users' devices.JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
        first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
        styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
        standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM)</p>

    <h1 id="Firebase">Firebase:-</h1>
    <p>Firebase is a set of hosting services for any type of application (Android, iOS, Javascript, Node.js, Java,
        Unity, PHP, C++ ...). It offers NoSQL and real-time hosting of databases, content, social authentication
        (Google, Facebook, Twitter and Github), and notifications, or services, such as a real-time communication server
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Firebase evolved from Envolve, a prior startup founded by James Tamplin and Andrew Lee in 2011. Envolve provided
        developers an API that enables the integration of online chat functionality into their websites. After releasing
        the chat service, Tamplin and Lee found that it was being used to pass application data that were not chat
        messages. Developers were using Envolve to sync application data such as game state in real time across their
        users. Tamplin and Lee decided to separate the chat system and the real-time architecture that powered it.[1]
        They founded Firebase as a separate company in 2011 and it launched to the public in April 2012.[2]

        Firebase's first product was the Firebase Realtime Database, an API that synchronizes application data across
        iOS, Android, and Web devices, and stores it on Firebase's cloud. The product assists software developers in
        building real-time, collaborative applications.</p>

    <p>GitHub, Inc. (/ˈɡɪthʌb/[a]) is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using
        Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature
        requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.[5] Headquartered in California,
        it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[6].It is commonly used to host open source software
        development projects.[7] As of June 2022, GitHub reported having over 83 million developers[8] and more than 200
        million repositories,[9] including at least 28 million public repositories.[10] It is the largest source code
        host as of November 2021.</p>
